## ðŸŽ¨ New in v2: Roman Bureaucracy Scene

### `gateway.html`
The main landing page shown when no token is present. It acts as a Roman bureaucratic office:

- Displays a dialog: *"I'll have the scribe run it to you later. Write your name on the chalk board."*
- Provides a chalkboard-style form to request a token via email

### `visual.html`
CSS stylesheet included in `gateway.html` via templating. Contains styles for:
- Pixel art scene
- Speech bubble
- Chalkboard input
- Bureaucrat layout and framing
- Placeholder animation zones (e.g., gates, centurions)

### `accessForm.html`
JavaScript logic included via templating:
- Handles email form submission using `google.script.run.sendAccessEmail(...)`
- Updates visual dialog and UI with confirmation messages
- Logs events and errors to console and optionally backend
